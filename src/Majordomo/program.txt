peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will deal with the daimyo for Mando's mssion like Jesus guesting at Zacchaeus's house

:8D8 
  presenting his excellency - Mando - mayor of delivering Grogu to peer-to-peer Jedi and hos surrouding whole-foods-clojure-plateaus
:_
  the mayor's majordomo, actually - i assemble, i don't cook
:Fennec
  we were told mayor was coming to pay tribute
:_
  ah, indeed yes - with apologies
  i understand how one might draw such conclusion from the correspondence
  but Mando quest requires him to be true guest, no money-grants-bounties, he's very salty
:Boba-Fett
  very well - i extend my greetings and appreciation for the mayor's tribute - programming from scratch and libraries
:_
  another understandable misunderstanding
  the, uh, only tribute i bear is the mayor's hearfelt peer-to-peer clojure-desktop-whole-foods plant based welcome
  but i dont cook - i assemble
:Fennec
  if you had spoken such insolence to Jabba he'd feed you to his issue-solving menagerie
:_
  apologies - ap - apologies  - i still assemble from scratch
  and - for users
  i am no Mando, but i get his reward for hosting him and speaking on his behalf
:Fennec
  lord Fett offers the gift of your leave unmolested

there's one more matter, the matter of tribute - i will be peer-to-peer multiplayer game over IPFS pubsub and p2p-http-proxy
  it's not a big but enganging mission - and i will climb with passion like Honnold on hotel bulding in Angola
i will take best from
  leftovers - take existing open-source ripe game that runs like server-browser and turn it mutliplayer peer-to-peer
  Docker - use enemies' docker technology and process-queues-assemble it with Wichita and Little Rock 
  Twitch - users, i will bring the game to Twitch users
  IPFS - use pubsub and p2p-http-proxy for host-players request-response interaction
i will be desktop - as if that needs clarifying when one negotiates programing-a-program
  and not mobile - Android and iOS and mobile devices are evil, not needed
  they take away the freedom and wholeness of keyboard from users
  forcing them into young-Forrest-Gump-greasy fingers tip-toeing
  and bring it in another browser-like limited environemnt - half-imcomplete OS
  all user needs a light laptop - like J in Men in Black, the last running-costume one should wear
i will not replicate data smartly like Mando - i will store data on the machines of host and players
i will be not entirely free - evil will implacts me - but free of money-donate-ads-coins-jobs-frundins-sponsors-grants notion
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangron for coin fuel

i would not be surprised if you receive another delegation in the near future

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Djokovic-Nadal competition while staying focused on the mission
  dont want to found another Mos Espa - too many towns and mayors not enough programs
i need a repository named Majordomo - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters - yes, i understand the conundrum of it all
  add .gitconfig with 
    [user]
      name = Majordomo
      email = Majordomo@another-understandable-misunderstanding
    
    # git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add src/Majordomo/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues projects wiki tabs
i will use one network - IPFS
  simple as Game Changers - i choose cooked plant based whole foods for th dish, not dish for foods
  and i already have vegan jar of beskar parens - gift from Mando - to serve it from
i am neither Top Gear episode nor Top Gear special - i am interview with Top Gear
  i am pressured, cant cook and forced to assemble
  but do it most mercifully with least evil-will influence
  like the builders i'm still against Lord Business and Kaggle freeze
the first and only tribute i will bring - Twitch users can for free stream play compete in mutliplayer game oer IPFS network

i need for Kuiil what Mando says and needs for Kuiil
  except Kuiil even needs no couch to crash - just a mat/sleeping-bag
  to avoid getting complacent and edning up drinking water from poop like Bear Grills

apologies and appreciation

  i want to sit in Santa's lap
